    "#### Today we will be discussing some of the basic tools we will be using throughout this course.\n",
    "- **JupyterHub**\n",
    "    - A stable and uniform micro-environment hosted by your instructor.\n",
    "    - We will use JupyterHub to introduce you to some of the tools we use of the first few weeks.\n",
    "    - Uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Command Line**\n",
    "    - The Command Line is a means of interacting with your computer with commands as opposed to clicking on things with your mouse.\n",
    "    - Mac's have an application called \"Terminal\", which is a command line shell.  You can thing of shells as a window or a portal that you access the command line through.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Git**\n",
    "    - First things first: Git is NOT GitHub...\n",
    "    - Git is a version control language.\n",
    "    - Git allows us to save entire folders and file systems and revert them to previous stages.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **GitHub**\n",
    "    - GitHub is a public application for saving and hosting your folders remotely that uses the Git langauage.\n",
    "    - Think of it as somewhat of a Google Drive for programming. (In that its a cloud service, not that its associated with your email.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Slack**\n",
    "    - Skype, but for Business and free.\n",
    "    - Still just as reasource unfriendly.  \n",
    "    - We will often use slack not only as a means of message communication, but also for polls, questions and other exercise based interactions durring lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maybe the best way to introduce these tools is to walk through a use-case example.\n",
    "This lesson is going to seem like a mobius strip of concepts, but I will be walking through how I created the lesson using resources available on JupyterHub and moved it to a [public website](https://github.com/samuel-stack) via Git and GitHub.  After that we will download the lesson to our own JupyterHub VMs so you can have your own copy.  "
